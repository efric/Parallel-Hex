Welcome! This is an AI agent written in Haskell which utilizes minmax search with alpha-beta pruning. You are given the option to run the program in parallel, with as many cores as your machine can handle. Parallelization occurs when expanding to the next search space of minmax. Please ensure you have The Haskell Tool Stack installed prior to running the application. 

To run : stack run
To build : stack build
To get an executable for testing application running time (e.g threadscope) : stack install
